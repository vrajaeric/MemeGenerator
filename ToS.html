<h1>Spam</h1>
	
<p>By definition, spam is messages that are either irrelevant or inappropriate. This includes malware links, posts that are lenghty, links exclusively to your own content or monetization, and others that are detrimental to the community.

<h1>Copyright<h/1>

<p>Respect it. Images on our site do. </p>
	
<h1>Pornographical Material</h1>

<p>This site is not pornographical. Such material will be subject to removal and action will be taken against accounts posting such material.</p>

<h1>Discrimination</h1>
	
<p>Memes are meant to be for good. When a meme is used to discriminate based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, etc., it makes the user experience less enjoyable. Freedom of expression is respected, but freedom has its boundaries, and those boundaries should be recognized.</p>
