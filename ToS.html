<h1>Spam</h1>
	
<p>By definition, spam is messages that are either irrelevant or inappropriate. This includes malware links, posts that are lenghty, links exclusively to your own content or monetization, and others that are detrimental to the community.

<h1>Copyright<h/1>

<p>Respect it. The images we have uploaded do. Contact us by email, outlining details of any infringement, should you suspect someone is doing so and wish to notify us about it.</p>
	
<h1>Pornographical Material</h1>

<p>This site is not pornographical. Such material will be subject to removal and punitive action will be taken against accounts posting such material.</p>

<h1>User Conduct</h1>
	
<p>Memes are meant to be used for good. When a meme is used for harassment, discrimination, commit/condone illegal behavior, or other acts that makes the user experience less enjoyable, it devalues what memes are meant for. Freedom of expression is respected, but freedom has its boundaries, and those boundaries should be recognized. Content that steps out of bounds is subject to deletion.</p>
